question 1:
Question 1 :
Explore and explain the various methods in console function
Explain them
Ex. console.log()
console.warn().
etc...


1.console.log()  <> used to log(print) the output to the console. We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean
# example:
console.log("bhuji")
console.log(1)
console.log(true)
console.log([1,5,8,9])

2.console.error() <>Used to log error message to the console..
#eg:
console.error("this is simple error")

3.console.warn() <> Used to log warning message to the console , this will highlighted in yellow color
eg:
console.warn("this is a warning")
4.console.clear() <> Used to clear the console. The console will be cleared..
eg:console.clear(); 
5.console.time() and console.timeEnd()  <>he amount of time spend by a block or a function, we can make use of the time() and timeEnd() methods
#eg:
console.time('abc'); 
 let fun =  function(){ 
     console.log('fun is running'); 
 } 
 let fun2 = function(){ 
     console.log('fun2 is running..'); 
 } 
 fun(); // calling fun(); 
 fun2(); // calling fun2(); 
console.timeEnd('abc'); 
6.console.table()
#eg:
console.table({"a":1 , "b" :2});
7.console.count()  <>This method is used to count the number that the function hit by this counting method.
# eg
for(let i=0;i<5;i++){ 
    console.count(i);
8.console.group() and console.groupEnd() <>  group() and groupEnd() methods of the console object allows us to group contents in a separate block, which will be indented
#eg:
 console.group('simple'); 
  console.warn('warning!'); 
  console.error('error here'); 
  console.log('vivi vini vici'); 
console.groupEnd('simple'); 
console.log('new section');

        console.log("The console. log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such as Webkit or Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message to a debugging console.");

        console.error("The Error Console is a tool available in most Mozilla-based applications that is used for reporting errors in the application chrome and in web pages user opens. It reports JavaScript-related errors and warnings, CSS errors and arbitrary messages from chrome code");

        console.warn("The console. warn() method is used to write a warning message in the console. So open the console to display the output (warning message).");

        console.log('The console.table() allows to display data in the console in a nice tabular format.');
        console.table({ a, b, c });

        console.log('%c Custom css script message', 'color:green;');

        console.log('Styntax: console.timeEnd(label), label: The name of the timer to stop. Once stopped, the elapsed time is automatically displayed in the Web Console along with an indicator that the time has ended. definition: Stops a timer that was previously started by calling console.time().');
        console.timeEnd('Time taken');

question 2 :
Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.

var():
The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined.
If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
# eg:
{
 let a=10;
 console.log(a);
} 
{
  a++;
  console.log(a);
} 

let()
The scope of a variable defined with the 
keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
eg:
let a =10;
The let statement allows you to create a variable with the scope limited to the block on which it is used.
It is similar to the variable we declare in other languages like Java, .NET, etc.

#eg
function nodeSimplified(){
  let a =10;
  console.log(a);  // output 10
  if(true){
   let a=20;
   console.log(a); // output 20
  }
  console.log(a);  // output 10
}
##const: The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. However if a variable is defined with keyword const, 
it cannot be reassigned.“const” cannot be re-assigned to a new value. However it CAN be mutated.

Example: const a =10;
#eg
function nodeSimplified(){
  const MY_VARIABLE =10;
  console.log(MY_VARIABLE);  //output 10 
}


#####Question no 3####
Write a brief intro on the avaiable datatypes in javascript.

ANS==
JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more:

var length = 16;                               // Number
var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String
var x = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};    // Object

#The Concept of Data Types
In programming, data types is an important concept.To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:

var x = 16 + "car";
JavaScript will treat the example above as:

var x = "16" + "car";

#JavaScript Strings--------
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".
Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes
#Example:-
var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";   // Using double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';   // Using single quotes

#JavaScript Numbers------
JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

#Example:-
var x1 = 34.00;     // Written with decimals
var x2 = 34;        // Written without decimals

#JavaScript Booleans-------
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.Booleans are often used in conditional testing.

#Example:-
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = 6;
(x == y)       // Returns true
(x == z)       // Returns false


#Undefined------
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined.
The type will also be undefined.A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.

#Example:-
var car;    // Value is undefined, type is undefined


#Null--------
In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist>Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null.You can empty an object by setting it to null:

#Example:-
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
person = null;    // Now value is null, but type is still an object


#JavaScript Objects-------
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.
It is the most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these data types in details in further articles.

#Example:-
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
